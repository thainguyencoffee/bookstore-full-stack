        In Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch), you’ll discover how LLMs work from the inside out. In this insightful book, bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples. You’ll go from the initial design and creation to pretraining on a general corpus, all the way to finetuning for specific tasks.

          <li>The large language models (LLMs) that power cutting-edge AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot seem like a miracle, but they’re not magic. This book demystifies LLMs by helping you build your own from scratch. You’ll get a unique and valuable insight into how LLMs work, learn how to evaluate their quality, and pick up concrete techniques to finetune and improve them.

        In Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch), you’ll discover how LLMs work from the inside out. In this insightful book, bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples. You’ll go from the initial design and creation to pretraining on a general corpus, all the way to finetuning for specific tasks.
